# Landing page for 🚀 Rockit - Fancy Text Generator and Formatter

Tired of the same old text? Want to add some pizzazz to your online conversations? Say hello to Rockit, your new best friend for all things text! 🎉

## 👾 Intro

With Rockit, you can transform any selected text on a webpage with just a right-click, that's right 𝐚𝐧𝐲! Choose from a variety of text formatting options like converting to UPPERCASE, lowercase, making it 𝐛𝐨𝐥𝐝 or 𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘤, or even changing the font to something 𝒇𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒚! 🌟 (Works everywhere, even if sites don't support it, use it to believe it✨)

But that’s not all! Click on the 🚀 Rockit extension icon, and you’ll get a neat info of your selected text, including word count, letter count, and line count. Perfect for those who need to keep track of their word usage! 📝

## 👮 Instructions For Use

-> Select the text you want to format on any webpage. Can be text inside a text input field or even the content displayed on the site 😈

-> Right-click to open the context menu and hover over the "🚀 Rockit - Fancy text..." option to see formatting choices.

-> Choose your desired formatting or fancy text option. Rockit will immediately apply the style to your selected text 🥳

-> To access more stats and information like word count, character count and such of the selected text, click the Rockit icon in your browser's extension toolbar 💃

-> You can pres ctrl + z or command + z (mac) to undo fancy text conversion, inside of a text input and fields 👻

## Note

-> First Time Install: You may need to reload webpages opened prior to Rockit installation, as that would help Rockit 🚀 to load along with webpage. (For Chrome and Chromium based browsers - basically anything that is not Mozilla or Safari)

-> Rockit works on most websites, but there may be some limitations based on the site's specific security policies, that is if reloading the page did not help. Selecting via pressing ctrl / cmd + A may not format text in some sites, use mouse cursor to select. (Site specific restriction)

-> Live preview was removed as it was causing performance issues on low end machines :(

## ⏰ Time Savings and Use Cases
